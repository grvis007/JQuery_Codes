            Mapped somewhere along the north eastern border of Madhya Pradesh amidst Satpura and
            Vindhya ranges, Bandhavgarh National Park is home to over a 100 Bengal Tigers in the
            country, that meander around freely. The park also breeds a great variety of leopards,
            deer and other species so you wouldn’t have to kill your time doing nothing until you spot
            a tiger. With a lush green geographical picture inviting you with all its glamour, a brief
            visit to the historic region will not be regretted. This one has been as underrated as any.
